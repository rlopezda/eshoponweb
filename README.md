# eshoponweb
CORE API Lab from the eBook
PLEASE NOTE :  In no way I am trying to use this project for commercial or any other use, appart from testing with CakeScript and Bamboo , Octopus Deploy personal workshop.

The original project can be found in : https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb,   which is a sample ASP.NET Core reference application, powered by Microsoft, demonstrating a single-process (monolithic) application architecture and deployment model.

Regards,
